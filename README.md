# EZBank

## Description

This is a super easy-to-use bank app! We designed it to give you a real bank app feel. Once you log in or sign up, you can check out your checking account, showing your balance. If you click on your checking account, you'll jump over to the overview page. There, you can see your transaction history. If you're already a user, you'll see all your transaction data because you've been using your account for a while. Our about us page lets you dive deeper into who we are, and we even offer a Spanish version for those who prefer it. During development, we faced some challenges, especially with the homeRoutes causing errors. With help from tutors, we decided to set up most of our handlers in the homeRoutes. A cool new feature we added is the ability to translate to Spanish. Initially, we wanted to translate everything, but it got tricky, so for now, it's just for the about us page. In the future, we plan to make the Spanish feature available everywhere and to add the option to sign up for a credit card.
